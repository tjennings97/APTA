Academic Progress Tracker for Athletics

The Academic Progress Tracker for Athletics was developed to provide a solution to collegiate athletics programs for tracking student athletes' academic progress. Currently, there are programs that use paper systems to monitor academics or do not do regular monitoring at all. ​
​
The Kutztown University softball team was the inspiration for this project. The system it currently uses requires players to submit weekly worksheets with updates on their progress. This method is tedious and creates waste. Replacing it with the Academic Progress Tracker for Athletics will streamline the monitoring process and increase efficiency.​
